The Calipio Online Screen Recorder is a powerful and easy WordPress plugin that boosts your webpage to a completely new level.

It adds a tremendous touch of professionalism and versatility to a huge variety of websites.

By adding this new form of communication you enter a new world of customer engagement and involvement.

Communicate with your customers quicker, more efficient and circumvent complicated misunderstandings due to a maximized concentration on what is really important:
Rather than awkwardly explaining in writing, let your customers show, tell and explain what their feedback is about.

If we make a short step back and have an in depth look into what communication with customers or colleagues is all about we quickly come to the conclusion that it is mostly about what your customers have experienced, noticed or perceived with your products, with your services or with whatever you represent. 

So it is about a certain gained knowledge or feeling. Truly an emotional experience in whatever way for sure. Feedback is something in your mind and you can easily tell and show it to somebody.

So why try to squeeze such feedback in a text field where one end will struggle to bring these emotions, feelings and experiences into words and then decipher it again on your side of the communication. 

Why not leave all these great ideas or answers in the form which they already are in your mind: In sentences, in actions, in showing or demonstrating something.
